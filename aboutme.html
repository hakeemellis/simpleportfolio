                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="roboto">I'm Hakeem Ellis, a passionate web developer and designer with a vision to transform the digital world. 
                 My journey in the realm of web development began with curiosity about how websites were truly made from the ground up. 
                 As I delved deeper, I realized that I had a knack for it and could be apart of something transformative if understood.
                 With that, I have garnered experience and an unwavering dedication to creating user-friendly and visually stunning websites.
                 It's not just about the code; it's about crafting immersive experiences. With a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                 I bring these elements together to build digital worlds that leave lasting impressions.</p>

                <p class="roboto">My work is a testament to my belief in the power of technology to make the world a better place. I see technology as a means to elevate the human experience. 
                 I am on a mission to ensure that every digital interaction is not just functional but also delightful for users.</p>

                <p class="roboto">Web development is a constantly evolving field, and I thrive on the need to constantly push oneself. What this prompts is continuous improvement, 
                 and every project completed is an opportunity for me to refine my skills and push creative boundaries. When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, 
                 you can find me exploring other facets of the world that makes my brain think outside the box to understand why things may work a certain way. 
                 These diverse interests and experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual, always open to new adventures and opportunities.</p>

                <p class="roboto">If you'd like to collaborate, share ideas or simply say hello, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hakeemellis510@gmail.com"><b>email me</b></a>. Let's connect and create something amazing together.</p>
